# Snake
## What?
A really basic game of snake made with c++ and SDL library.

## Why?
After ""learning"" c++ for the first year of college, I switched to c because it is simpler and it made more sense. Now, after taking PdeP (programming paradigmsÂ¿) in college and getting to know OOP better, I understand (some of) the advantages c++ brings to the table. Overall, a fun experience.

## Instalation
Just gitcloning this and running the Makefile should be ok if you are in a linux distro. You'll need SDL2 and SDL2main packages for compiling. There is no support for mswindows at the moment (and probably never will be) :p.
